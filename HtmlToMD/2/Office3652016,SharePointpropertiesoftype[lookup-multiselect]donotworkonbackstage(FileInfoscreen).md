**Issue:**

You have Office 365 / 2016 and open a document from SharePoint that has
SharePoint metadata properties of type \[lookupÂ - multi select\] and
they do not show and can not be set on the Office backstage area (File /
Info screen)

**Cause:**

This is a current design limitation with Office, there are no current
plans to change this behavior.

**Workarounds:**

If using Word, you can use the SharePoint properties screen (View tab \\
Properties see screen shot below) or to use the properties page from the
SharePoint web
UI.

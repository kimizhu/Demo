**Issue:**

It is possible to get into a situation where users could be synced with
Office 365 but not have access to SharePoint Online or SkyDrive Pro
services.  When this happens the Office Save As screen (aka
Backstage) shows these Office 365 connections to users even though they
can not use them.

Also in the contact card a link called "SharePoint" is shown that points
to the users MySite that they possibly do not even have.

There are some group policies that control the Backstage area, but they
are mostly all or nothing, removing all SharePoint referencing not just
the Office 365 ones.

The workaround below should remove the O365 SharePoint on line content
from the Office Save As screen and the "SharePoint" link in the contact
card.

 

**Workaround:**

**None**

**** 

**Current Status: **

****This is a known issue, it could be addressed in a future version of
Microsoft Office.

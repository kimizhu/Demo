**Issue:**

Office 2010, IE 9 - IE10, SharePoint Online (SPO O365), when a user
clicks on a document in a SharePoint document library two instances of
the office application are started.  Two windows showing the same
document are opened by the single click in the document library.

**Workaround:**

\*\*This workaround does have some side effects, lose benefits of the
trusted zone settings**\*\***

In Internet Explorer go to "Internet Options" screen, and select the
"Security" tab.

Remove the SharePoint online address from the trusted sites list.  
 

**Current status:**

This is a known issue and is actively being looked at by the product
groups right now. 

The estimated sever side fix date is sometime in March.

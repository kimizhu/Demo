**Summary:**

When a SharePoint document library is set to open in client application
and the full Visio client is not installed, when the Visio document is
clicked on you may receive a message to search the store for
applications that support ms-visio

Â 

**Workaround:**

Instead of clicking on the document link pick to "view in browser" or
install the full Visio client application.

If SharePoint Online is being used, then when the new list experience
option is turned on, Visio documents will always open in the web viewer
first.

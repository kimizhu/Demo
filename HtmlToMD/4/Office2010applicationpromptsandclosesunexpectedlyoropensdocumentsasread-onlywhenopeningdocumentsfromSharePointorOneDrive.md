When using Microsoft Office 2010 to open an Office document, such as a
Word document or Excel workbook, from SharePoint or OneDrive, you may
receive unexpected credential prompts followed by the Office application
closing with an error.

This is a known issue caused by the following updates for Office 2010:

 

**October 2015 update for Office 2010 (KB3055034)**

**November 2015 update for Office 2010 (KB3101521)**

You may also experience an issue with Office 2010 opening SharePoint or
OneDrive documents as read-only.

These issues have been fixed in the following December update for Office

You may also encounter an Office application closing unexpectedly when
saving a file as a different name (Save As) to SharePoint.

This is a known issue caused by the December 2015 update for Office 2010
above, and by the following January 2016 update for Office 2010:

 

**January 2016 update for Office 2010 (KB3114553)**

You can also use the following workaround: Download the document from
SharePoint/OneDrive to your local computer. Open the file to make
changes and save it back to the local computer. Then upload the file
back to SharePoint/OneDrive.

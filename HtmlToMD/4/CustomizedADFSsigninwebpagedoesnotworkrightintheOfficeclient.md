**Summary:**

You have customized the ADFS sign-in page with your own jscript code per

<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn636121.aspx>

All works fine when the page is viewed in IE, but does not work right
when viewed as a popup from Office.

Â 

**Current Status:**

Right now this is a design limitation, the code simply does not run.

The product group has been informed of this limitation and it may or may
not be addressed in the future.

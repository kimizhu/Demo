**Summary:**

You have a SharePoint document library where the "Title" property is
required and you are using an Office 2016 application.  When you try to
save the document you get an error saying
that:

<span style="margin: 0px;color: teal;font-family: &#39;Verdana&#39;,sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">"This
file cannot be saved because some properties are missing or invalid.
U</span><span style="margin: 0px;color: teal;font-family: &#39;Verdana&#39;,sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">se
the document properties under the File menu to provide the correct
property values. Errors for required and invalid properties are marked
With a red border.
</span><span style="margin: 0px;color: teal;font-family: &#39;Verdana&#39;,sans-serif;font-size: 10pt">"
</span>

But when you go to the properties section under the File menu no
property is highlighted as being required.  Even though the "Title"
property should be highlighted.

**Cause:**

This is a defect.

**Current status:**

The fix for this issue has been released, Office 365 Current Channel
update 16.0.7870.2020

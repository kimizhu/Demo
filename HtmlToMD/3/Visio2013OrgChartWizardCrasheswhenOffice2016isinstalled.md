**Summary:**

You have Office 2016 installed and have Visio 2013 installed.  When
using the Visio Organization Chart Wizard to fetch data from Exchange
Server, Visio Crashes.

 

**Cause:**

There is an incompatibility with this feature and Office 2016, the Visio
2013 Organization Chart Wizard was designed to work with Outlook 2013.

 

**Workaround:**

The Visio version must match the Outlook version for this feature to
work, so Visio 2013 needs to have Outlook 2013 installed and Visio 2016
needs to have Outlook 2016 installed.

 

**Status:**

The product group is aware of this feature and it is on their issue
backlog and may get addressed in the future.

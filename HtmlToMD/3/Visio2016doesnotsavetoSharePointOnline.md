\*\*4/17/2017 UPDATE  this issue will be resolved in the May 2017 update
to Visio Click To Run 2016.

**Summary:**

SharePoint Online opens Visio 2016 documents as read only from document
library's.  Visio handles read only drawings poorly and users are unable
to save any changes back to the server.  Users must save to a local
directory then upload the file back to SharePoint.

 

**Cause:**

This is a software defect.

 

**Workaround:**

Open the Visio 2016 files in the web viewer first, then from the web
viewer pick to open the file in the rich Visio client.

Or

Use the Visio 2016 rich client app to open the files directly with File
/ Open, or from the recent documents list.

 

**Current Status:**

The Visio product group hopes to have this issue addressed by July 2017.

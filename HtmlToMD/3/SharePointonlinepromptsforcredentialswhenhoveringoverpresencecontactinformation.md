**Summary:**

You have Office 2016 installed, have ADFS and ADAL authentication
mode and are accessing a SharePoint online web page.  When you mouse
over the presence indicators or try to look at contact info you are
continually prompted to enter credentials.  This may only impact remote
users.

 

**Cause:**

This is a product limitation.

 

**Workaround:**

Disable the NameCtrl Class IE-addon

 

**Current Status:**

Microsoft wants to address this issue, but the changes required are too
big for a hotfix.  This scenario will be addressed sometime in the
future.

**Issue:**

With PowerPoint 2013 when opening a document for edit from SharePoint
2010 or SharePoint 2013 you may see an error similar to this:

"Sorry, we couldn't find C:\\users\\\<userid\>\\Desktop\\%u. Is it
possible it was moved, renamed, or deleted?"

This only happens when the SharePoint server is in an IE security zone
that is set to use IE protected mode.

 

**Workaround:**

You can turn off protected mode for the IE security zone.

 

**Current Status:**

A fix for this issue has been released:

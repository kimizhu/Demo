**Issue:** You have Office 365 client application (Word, Excel,
PowerPoint) trying to open a document from SharePoint or OneDrive via
the Office recently used document list and receive error: \"Sorry,
something went wrong\" **Cause:** Office 365 no longer support the
registry key:
\[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Roaming\]
\"RoamingSettingsDisabled\"
\[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Common\\Roaming\]
\"RoamingSettingsDisabled\" **Workaround:** The workaround is to delete
the above registry keys or set it to 0. If you need to reduce the
traffic that Office is sending to the internet you can use these
registry keys:

-   HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\*16*.0\\Common\\Internet
    Name: UseOnlineContent Type: DWORD Value: 0 -Do not allow Office to
    connect to the Internet. Office applications do not connect to the
    Internet to access online services or to download the latest online
    content from Office.com. Connected features of Office are disabled.
-   HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\*16*.0\\Common\\Internet
    Name: UseOnlineContent Type: DWORD Value: 0 -Â Do not allow Office to
    connect to the Internet. Office applications do not connect to the
    Internet to access online services or to download the latest online
    content from Office.com. Connected features of Office are disabled.
